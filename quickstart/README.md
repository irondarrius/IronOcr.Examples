## OCR with Tesseract 5 - Getting Started with C# Coding

Letâ€™s explore how effortlessly you can begin extracting text from images using C#, as demonstrated in the example below.

Here's the paraphrased section from the provided text:

### Simple Text Extraction

```csharp
string extractedText = new IronTesseract().Read(@"img\Screenshot.png").Text;
```

This single line of code demonstrates the straightforward method to extract text using IronOCR in a C# application. Simply create a new instance of the `IronTesseract` class and utilize the `Read` method on an image file to capture the text. The result is immediately accessible through the `Text` property of the returned object.

Here is the paraphrased section of the article:

```cs
// Read text from an image using IronTesseract
string extractedText = new IronTesseract().Read(@"img\Screenshot.png").Text;
```

### Customizable Basic Example

Below is a straightforward example demonstrating how to implement text recognition from an image using C# or VB.NET with IronOCR:

```cs
using IronOcr;  // IronOcr namespace reference

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();  // Create instance of IronTesseract
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();  // Create OcrInput object

// Load an image
input.LoadImage("images/example.jpg");

// Read the text from the image
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);
// Output the extracted text to console
Console.WriteLine(result.Text);
```

Below is the paraphrased section of the article, with the relative URL paths resolved to `ironsoftware.com` as specified:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Create an instance of IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput imageInput = new OcrInput();

// Loading multiple image files into the OCR input
imageInput.LoadImage("images/sample.jpeg");

// Execute OCR to read text from images
OcrResult ocrTextResult = ocrEngine.Read(imageInput);
Console.WriteLine(ocrTextResult.Text);
```

### OCR PDF Files in C#

This method can be equally applied to retrieve text from any PDF files.

Here is the paraphrased section of the article with the code appropriately reformatted:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput document = new OcrInput();

// Load a specific PDF with given page numbers, and provide password for protected files
document.LoadPdf("example.pdf", Password: "password");

// Perform OCR on loaded PDF
OcrResult ocrText = ocrEngine.Read(document);
Console.WriteLine(ocrText.Text);

// Output the count of pages processed
Console.WriteLine($"{ocrText.Pages.Length} Pages");
``` 

In this rewritten snippet, variable names are made more descriptive to enhance code readability, and comments are adjusted to be more informative about each step.

### OCR Processing for MultiPage TIFF Images

Explore how to perform OCR on TIFF images containing multiple pages using the IronOCR library. This feature of IronOCR allows developers to efficiently handle and extract text from TIFF images that come with several frames.

#### Execute OCR on Multi-Page TIFF Files

Let's employ the `IronOcr` class to initiate OCR on multipage TIFF files, extracting readable text from each specified frame. Below is the example in C#.

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Create an instance of IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();

// Prepare the input with TIFF image frames
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
var pageIndexes = new int[] { 1, 2 };  // Define which pages of the TIFF to process
input.LoadImageFrames("multi-frame.tiff", pageIndexes);

// Perform OCR and obtain the result
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);
Console.WriteLine(result.Text);  // Display the extracted text
```

In the code snippet above, we initialize `IronTesseract`, load the targeted pages of a multi-page TIFF file, and finally, execute OCR to get the text which is then printed out. This process is straightforward and leverages the powerful OCR capabilities of the IronOCR to manage multi-page document scans efficiently.

Here is a paraphrased version of the section from the article:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Instantiate IronTesseract for OCR capabilities
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();
// Define the pages to OCR from the multi-frame TIFF image
int[] selectedFrameIndices = new int[] { 1, 2 };
ocrInput.LoadImageFrames("multi-frame.tiff", selectedFrameIndices);
// Perform OCR on the selected frames
OcrResult ocrOutput = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);
// Output the extracted text to the console
Console.WriteLine(ocrOutput.Text);
```

### Barcodes and QR Code Reading

IronOCR stands out with its capability to simultaneously read barcodes and QR codes during its text scanning operations. The `OcrResult.OcrBarcode` class provides developers with comprehensive details about each barcode detected in the documents. This functionality integrates seamlessly into the text recognition process, enhancing the usefulness of the OCR operation by extracting both text and encoded information from images and documents.

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Instantiate IronTesseract for OCR operations
IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();

// Enable barcode reading in the configuration
ocr.Configuration.ReadBarCodes = true;

// Create an OcrInput object to load the image
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
input.LoadImage("img/Barcode.png");

// Perform OCR on the loaded image
OcrResult ocrResult = ocr.Read(input);

// Iterate through and print the value of each barcode found in the image
foreach (var barcode in ocrResult.Barcodes)
{
    // Accessing the barcode value
    Console.WriteLine(barcode.Value);
}
```

### Targeted Text Extraction in Images with IronOCR

IronOCR's suite of image recognition functionalities includes the capability to focus on specific portions of a document or image for text extraction. This targeted OCR feature proves exceptionally beneficial when dealing with standard forms, enhancing both time efficiency and overall application performance.

To leverage this feature for defining specific crop regions, a reference to `System.Drawing` must be incorporated into your project. This allows you to utilize the `System.Drawing.Rectangle` object to specify the exact area for text recognition.

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize a new IronTesseract instance
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Create a new OcrInput object to manage OCR input
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();

// Set up the content region for OCR in pixels
var regionOfInterest = new System.Drawing.Rectangle(x: 215, y: 1250, width: 1335, height: 280);

// Load the image along with the specified region
ocrInput.LoadImage("document.png", regionOfInterest);

// Process the OCR on the provided image and region
OcrResult ocrResult = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);

// Output the OCR results to the console
Console.WriteLine(ocrResult.Text);
```

### Enhanced OCR for Low-Resolution Scans

The `OcrInput` class from IronOCR provides superior capabilities to rectify scans that typical Tesseract implementations struggle with.

Here is the paraphrased section with improved comments and minor alterations in the code, while maintaining the original functionality:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize the Iron Tesseract OCR engine
IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();

// Create an OCR input container
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();

// Define the specific pages to process
int[] pageIndices = { 1, 2 };
input.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.tiff", pageIndices);

// Apply an image filter to reduce noise from poor-quality scans
input.DeNoise();

// Apply correction for skew and misalignment
input.Deskew();

// Execute the OCR process and obtain the result
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);

// Output the recognized text to the console
Console.WriteLine(result.Text);
```

### Convert OCR Outcomes to Searchable PDFs

The code snippet provided below demonstrates the method for transforming OCR results into searchable PDF documents using C#.

```cs
using IronOcr;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
input.Title = "Quarterly Business Review";
input.LoadImage("image1.jpeg");    // Load the first image
input.LoadImage("image2.png");     // Load the second image
var pageIndices = new int[] { 1, 2 };
input.LoadImageFrames("image3.gif", pageIndices);  // Loading multiple frames from an image

OcrResult ocrResult = ocr.Read(input);
ocrResult.SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable-document.pdf");  // Output as searchable PDF
```

This process enables you to convert images and document scans into a PDF format that retains the ability to search text, leveraging IronOCR's capabilities to read and recognize content efficiently.

Here's the paraphrased section of the article:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Create an instance of IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Initialize the OcrInput with specific images
using (var ocrInput = new OcrInput())
{
    // Set the title of the document
    ocrInput.Title = "Quarterly Report";

    // Load single images into the OCR engine
    ocrInput.LoadImage("image1.jpeg");
    ocrInput.LoadImage("image2.png");

    // Define which frames from a multi-frame image to process
    var framesToProcess = new int[] {1, 2};
    ocrInput.LoadImageFrames("image3.gif", framesToProcess);

    // Perform the OCR operation
    OcrResult ocrResult = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);

    // Save the results as a searchable PDF
    ocrResult.SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable.pdf");
}
```

### Converting TIFF Files to Searchable PDFs

The process below demonstrates how to transform TIFF images into searchable PDF documents using IronOCR:

```cs
using IronOcr;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
// Specify the pages to be converted
var pageIndices = new int[] { 1, 2 };
input.LoadImageFrames("example.tiff", pageIndices);

// Perform OCR on the loaded pages
OcrResult ocrResult = ocr.Read(input);

// Save the OCR output as a searchable PDF
ocrResult.SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable.pdf");
```

This workflow in C# leverages the `IronTesseract` class to OCR multiple frames of a TIFF file and then directly save it as a PDF file where the text can be searched and indexed, enhancing accessibility and search capability.

Here's the paraphrased section of the article incorporating improvements in the code comments and using the required absolute URL path:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Create a new IronTesseract instance
IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();

// Setting up the page indices to be read from the TIFF file
int[] selectedPages = new int[] { 1, 2 };
input.LoadImageFrames("example.tiff", selectedPages);

// Perform OCR on the selected TIFF pages and save as a searchable PDF file
ocr.Read(input).SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable.pdf");
```

This revised code snippet provides the same functionality, now with more descriptive comments to make it clearer what each step is doing.

### Exporting OCR Output as HTML

IronOCR also enables the conversion of OCR results into HTML format. This capability provides flexibility in handling OCR data, making it suitable for web-based integration or further processing in HTML-enabled environments.

```cs
using IronOcr;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
input.Title = "Html Title";
input.LoadImage("image1.jpeg");

OcrResult ocrResult = ocr.Read(input);
ocrResult.SaveAsHocrFile("results.html");
```

In the code snippet above, the `IronTesseract` class is used to instantiate the OCR engine, and an `OcrInput` instance is created and loaded with an image. After the OCR process completes, the results are saved in an HTML file using the `SaveAsHocrFile` method, offering an elegant way to manage and display the OCR data in HTML format.

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();

// Create an OcrInput instance and provide a title
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput() {
    Title = "Html Title"
};

// Load an image for OCR processing
input.LoadImage("image1.jpeg");

// Perform OCR on the loaded image
OcrResult ocrResult = ocr.Read(input);

// Save the OCR output as an HTML file
ocrResult.SaveAsHocrFile("results.html");
```

## OCR Image Enhancement Filters

IronOCR enhances OCR capabilities with specialized filters that can be applied to `OcrInput` objects. These filters are designed to optimize the performance and accuracy of OCR operations.

Below is the paraphrased content for the **Image Enhancement Code Example** section with any relative URLs resolved to ironsoftware.com:

---

### Example of Image Improvement Code

Explore how to enhance image quality to maximize OCR accuracy using the IronOCR library. This snippet provides insights into using various image filters to clean up a poor-quality image before performing OCR.

```csharp
using IronOcr;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
input.LoadImage("LowQuality.jpeg");

// Apply filters to reduce noise and correct skew in the image
input.DeNoise();  // Remove digital noise from the image
input.Deskew();   // Correct any skew to align the text properly

OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);
Console.WriteLine(result.Text);
```

This example demonstrates how to employ essential filters, `DeNoise` and `Deskew`. These filters handle common issues like digital noise and misalignment, which are frequent in scanned documents.

Here's the paraphrased section of the article:

```cs
// Import the IronOcr namespace to access the IronTesseract and OcrInput classes
using IronOcr;

// Create an instance of IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Initialize an OcrInput object to handle the image
using OcrInput imageInput = new OcrInput();
// Load a low-quality image file into the OCR engine
imageInput.LoadImage("LowQuality.jpeg");

// Apply de-noising to clean up the image
imageInput.DeNoise();

// Correct any skewed angles in the image
imageInput.Deskew();

// Perform OCR on the cleaned and straightened image
OcrResult ocrText = ocrEngine.Read(imageInput);

// Output the extracted text to the console
Console.WriteLine(ocrText.Text);
```

### OCR Image Filters Provided by IronOCR

IronOCR incorporates a suite of input filters designed to enhance OCR performance, detailed as follows:

- **`OcrInput.Rotate(double degrees)`**: This function rotates images by a specified number of degrees in a clockwise direction. For counterclockwise rotations, negative values should be used.
- **`OcrInput.Binarize()`**: Converts every pixel in an image to either black or white, which can enhance OCR accuracy in scenarios with low text-background contrast.
- **`OcrInput.ToGrayScale()`**: Changes every pixel in an image to a shade of gray, potentially speeding up the OCR process though it may not necessarily enhance accuracy.
- **`OcrInput.Contrast()`**: Automatically boosts the contrast of an image which often aids in both the speed and accuracy of OCR in images with low contrast.
- **`OcrInput.DeNoise()`**: This filter is employed to clear out digital noise from images and is best used when noise presence is anticipated.
- **`OcrInput.Invert()`**: Inverts the colors of images, where white turns black and vice versa.
- **`OcrInput.Dilate()`**: A morphological operation that increases the size of object boundaries in an image, which is the opposite of erosion.
- **`OcrInput.Erode()`**: Another morphological process, eroding shrinks object boundaries in an image, effectively the reverse of dilation.
- **`OcrInput.Deskew()`**: Corrects the alignment of scanned documents, making them properly oriented and perpendicular, crucial for effective OCR, especially since Tesseract has a low tolerance for skewed images.
- **`OcrInput.EnhanceResolution()`** and **`EnhanceResolution`**: These settings work to detect and improve the resolution of images below 275 DPI by upscaling and sharpening the text, which, although time-consuming, generally makes the OCR process more efficient overall.
- **`Language`**: IronOCR supports 22 international languages allowing developers to apply specific languages to enhance OCR accuracy.
- **`Strategy`**: Offers two strategies: a quicker but less accurate scan, or a slower, AI-enhanced method that improves text accuracy by analyzing word relationships.
- **`ColorSpace`**: Allows selecting between grayscale and color OCR, with grayscale usually being sufficient unless the image contains colors that are visually similar but distinct in hue.
- **`DetectWhiteTextOnDarkBackgrounds`**: This feature adjusts for scenarios where the text color and background are inverted, which is typically problematic for standard OCR.
- **`InputImageType`**: Guides the OCR on whether it is processing a complete document or just an excerpt, like a screenshot.
- **`RotateAndStraighten`**: An advanced feature that not only corrects document orientation but can also adjust for images with perspective issues.
- **`ReadBarcodes`**: This practical capability allows IronOCR to detect and decode barcodes and QR codes during the OCR process without significantly extending the process time.
- **`ColorDepth`**: Determines the bit depth per pixel used in OCR operations, influencing both the quality and processing time of OCR. Higher color depths can improve quality at the cost of longer processing times.

## Multilingual OCR Support

IronOCR boasts comprehensive multilingual support, offering **125 international languages**. These language packs are available as DLLs and can be [acquired from Iron Software's official page](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/languages/) or via the [NuGet Package Manager](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=IronOcr.Languages).


The supported languages range from widely spoken ones such as German, English, French, Chinese, and Japanese to specialized ones designed for reading passport MRZs, MICR checks, financial data, and license plates, among others. Furthermore, IronOCR is versatile enough to utilize any Tesseract ".traineddata" file, including custom files that you may develop.

### Example of Multiple Languages Support

The IronOCR software allows for text recognition in various languages. Hereâ€™s an outlined process for applying the Arabic language pack:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// PM> Install-Package IronOcr.Languages.Arabic
IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
ocr.Language = OcrLanguage.Arabic;

using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();

// Select multiple image frames
var pageIndices = new int[] { 1, 2 };
input.LoadImageFrames("img/arabic.gif", pageIndices);

/* Adding image filters could enhance readability in some cases,
   especially where the input quality is not optimal. */
  
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);
// Arabic text may not display correctly in some consoles.
// Saving output to a file is a feasible alternative.
result.SaveAsTextFile("arabic.txt");
```

Additionally, IronOCR supports simultaneous multi-language OCR, which is particularly useful when dealing with documents containing multiple languages. This can enhance the accuracy of metadata and URL recognition in documents. Here's how you might perform OCR with both Chinese and English:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// PM> Install-Package IronOcr.Languages.ChineseSimplified
IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
ocr.Language = OcrLanguage.ChineseSimplified;

// Adding English as a secondary language
ocr.AddSecondaryLanguage(OcrLanguage.English);

using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
input.LoadPdf("multi-language.pdf");
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);
result.SaveAsTextFile("results.txt");
``` 

These examples illustrate the flexibility of IronOCR in handling different languages and optimizing OCR tasks for complex language scenarios.

Here is the paraphrased version of the specified code section:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Install IronOcr.Languages.Arabic via Package Manager
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();
ocrEngine.Language = OcrLanguage.Arabic;

// Prepare the OCR input
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();
int[] imageIndices = new int[] { 1, 2 };

// Load specific image frames for OCR
ocrInput.LoadImageFrames("img/arabic.gif", imageIndices);

// Optional image enhancements can be applied if low-quality input
// Here, IronTesseract can process even poor-quality images which standard Tesseract may struggle with.
OcrResult ocrTextResult = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);

// Since the console may struggle with displaying Arabic text,
// the output is instead saved directly to a file.
ocrTextResult.SaveAsTextFile("arabic.txt");
```

### Example with Multiple Languages

IronOCR supports simultaneous OCR in multiple languages, which is particularly useful for extracting English metadata and URLs from Unicode documents. This feature enhances the libraryâ€™s flexibility when handling international texts.

Here's the paraphrased section from the article:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Install the Chinese Simplified language pack for IronOcr via Package Manager
IronTesseract ironTesseract = new IronTesseract();
ironTesseract.Language = OcrLanguage.ChineseSimplified;

// Introduce additional languages to the OCR process
ironTesseract.AddSecondaryLanguage(OcrLanguage.English);

using OcrInput imageInput = new OcrInput();
imageInput.LoadPdf("multi-language.pdf");
OcrResult ocrResult = ironTesseract.Read(imageInput);
ocrResult.SaveAsTextFile("results.txt");
```

## Detailed OCR Results Objects
