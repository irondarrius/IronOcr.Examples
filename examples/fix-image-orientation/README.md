## `Image Rotation`

Rotate images by specifying the number of degrees. To rotate them clockwise, enter a positive value; for counterclockwise rotation, input a negative number.

## `Correct Image Orientation`

This operation adjusts the alignment of an image so that it is properly upright and aligned at right angles. This adjustment is especially crucial for OCR operations, as Tesseract can only handle image skewness of up to 5 degrees.

## `Adjust Image Size`

This function adjusts the size of `OcrInput` pages while maintaining their proportional dimensions.
