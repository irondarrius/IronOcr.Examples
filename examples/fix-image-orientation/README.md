## Rotate Images

Adjust the orientation of images by rotating them a specific number of degrees in a clockwise direction. To rotate images counter-clockwise, specify a negative degree value.

## Deskew

Correct the alignment of images to ensure they are upright and properly oriented. This adjustment is particularly beneficial for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processes, as the Tesseract engine has a limited skew tolerance of up to 5 degrees.

## Scale

Proportionally resize pages within an `OcrInput` to alter their dimensions.
