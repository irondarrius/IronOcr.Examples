***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/examples/ocr-tesseract-custom-languages/>***

Iron Tesseract OCR is fully compatible with custom or externally sourced languages and fonts that adhere to the Tesseract `.traineddata` file format, specifically version 4 or higher. These files are often available on [Github.com](https://github.com/).

For those interested in developing their own custom fonts or language packs, we suggest consulting our [guide on crafting custom Tesseract language packs](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/troubleshooting/custom-ocr-language-packs/).
