Optical Character Recognition (OCR) operates most effectively and accurately when processing text of a single color against a uniform background color.

The `SelectTextColor` feature converts the image into a binary format where all pixels of the specific text color are represented in black (considering different shades confidently) while converting all other pixels to white.

For instance, if our goal is to exclusively process text of a specific color or set of colors against any colored background, `SelectTextColor` and `SelectTextColors` will convert all text of the selected colors to black, while changing text and background of other colors to white. This operation has a level of flexibility where users can define a tolerance for the exact RGB values. This approach eliminates the need for complex preparation of images using tools like Photoshop or ImageMagick before performing OCR.

When dealing with colors, `IronSoftare.Drawing.Color` adheres to HTML color codes.
