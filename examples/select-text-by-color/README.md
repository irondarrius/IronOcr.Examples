Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is most effective and precise when processing text of a single color against a uniform background color.

Using the `SelectTextColor` function, the software can binarize an image, converting pixels of the targeted text color to black (factoring in different shades confidently), while transforming all other pixels to white.

For instance, to focus OCR on text of specific color(s) against any colored background, `SelectTextColor` and `SelectTextColors` will alter the text of the chosen color(s) to black, and turn all non-selected colors and backgrounds to white. This allows for some flexibility as users can set a tolerance level for the exact RGB values. This functionality effectively eliminates the need for tools like Photoshop or ImageMagick for pre-processing images before OCR.

The API uses the `IronSoftware.Drawing.Color` for defining HTML colors.
