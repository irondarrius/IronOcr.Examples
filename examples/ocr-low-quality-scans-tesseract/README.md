The `IronTesseract` OCR class offers detailed control, allowing C# and .NET developers to integrate OCR capabilities — converting images and PDFs to text — into their applications. Moreover, developers can tailor the performance to suit their particular needs.

Users can adjust various settings to optimize the balance between conversion speed and accuracy, based on practical examples. These settings encompass options like `CleanBackgroundNoise`, `EnhanceContrast`, `EnhanceResolution`, `Language`, `Strategy`, `RotateAndStraighten`, `ColorSpace`, `DetectWhiteTextOnDarkBackgrounds`, and `InputImageType`.

Such configurations significantly improve the readability of lower-quality scans, which standard Tesseract may not process effectively.
