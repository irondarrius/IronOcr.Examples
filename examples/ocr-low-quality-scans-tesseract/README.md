The `IronTesseract` OCR Class offers detailed control to C# and .NET developers, enabling them to integrate OCR (conversion of images and PDFs to text) capabilities into their applications while optimizing performance tailored to their specific requirements.

Developers can achieve an optimal balance between speed and accuracy by adjusting settings, based on practical examples. These settings include: `CleanBackgroundNoise`, `EnhanceContrast`, `EnhanceResolution`, `Language`, `Strategy`, `RotateAndStraighten`, `ColorSpace`, `DetectWhiteTextOnDarkBackgrounds`, and `InputImageType`.

Such configurations enhance the ability of `IronTesseract` to process low quality scans that standard free Tesseract software might not successfully interpret.
