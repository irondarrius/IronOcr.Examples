The `IronTesseract` OCR class offers detailed control for C# and .NET developers. It enables the incorporation of OCR capabilities (converting images and PDFs to text) into their applications and allows them to optimize performance according to specific requirements.

Developers can achieve an ideal balance between speed and accuracy by adjusting various settings while using real-world examples. Some of these settings include: `CleanBackgroundNoise`, `EnhanceContrast`, `EnhanceResolution`, Language, Strategy, `RotateAndStraighten`, `ColorSpace`, `DetectWhiteTextOnDarkBackgrounds`, and `InputImageType`.

This level of customization is particularly effective for processing low-quality scans that typical Tesseract tools might not be able to decipher properly.
