The `OcrResult` object from Iron Tesseract can capture barcodes and QR Codes while performing OCR by setting `Ocr.Configuration.ReadBarCodes` to `true`.

This feature enhances the core capabilities of the standard, open-source Tesseract offering, making it a significant enhancement by Iron Software.
