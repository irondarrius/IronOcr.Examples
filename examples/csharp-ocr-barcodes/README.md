The `OcrResult` object from Iron Tesseract is capable of reading barcodes and QR Codes while performing OCR when this capability is activated with the property `Ocr.Configuration.ReadBarCodes = true;`.

This feature exemplifies one of the many enhancements that Iron Software offers over the standard functionality found in the free version of Tesseract.
