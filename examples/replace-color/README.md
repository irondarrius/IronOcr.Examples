OCR technology operates more efficiently and with greater accuracy when processing black text on a white background.

In scenarios where text is presented in colors like blue on a pink background, converting the blue to black and the pink to white prior to OCR can enhance performance.

Using `System.Drawing` for such color transformations can be inefficient and sluggish. Conversely, IronOCR offers a streamlined and automated solution.

The method `OcrInput.ReplaceColor` in IronOCR facilitates the substitution of one color for another within a document. It includes a tolerance feature that allows you to define how close the replacement color must match the original in terms of RGB percentage.

This effectively eliminates the necessity for using complex tools like Photoshop or ImageMagick to preprocess images for OCR.
