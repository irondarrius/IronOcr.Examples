Introducing an Improved Code Framework with `OcrInput` for Enhanced OCR Control in Development.

This framework serves as a foundational element for creating high-performance OCR applications using C#.

Key features encompass both automatic and manual image enhancements, secure memory management to prevent leaks, support for multithreading, handling of multipage documents, and capabilities to convert OCR results to PDF and HTML formats. Additionally, it supports OCR operations on PDFs and multipage TIFF files.
