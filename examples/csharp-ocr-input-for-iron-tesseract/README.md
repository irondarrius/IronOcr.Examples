Introducing Enhanced Control in OCR Processing with `OcrInput`

`OcrInput` offers a robust framework for designing high-performance OCR applications using C#. This architecture not only enhances developer oversight but also improves the application's overall efficiency.

Key features of `OcrInput` include both automatic and manual image optimizations, secure management that prevents memory leaks, support for multithreading, and the ability to handle multipage documents. It also supports converting OCR results to PDF and HTML formats, and can process OCR for PDF and multipage TIFF files.
