The `IronTesseract` class from Iron Software provides an efficient solution for .NET developers by enabling the automated conversion of TIFF images to searchable PDF documents. This functionality is essential for processing document images into formats that are more usable and accessible, particularly beneficial in archiving, searching, and managing documents digitally.

Below is a snippet illustrating how to use `IronTesseract` to convert a TIFF file to a searchable PDF:

```csharp
// Include IronOcr to use its OCR capabilities
using IronOcr;

// Create an instance of IronTesseract 
var ocr = new IronTesseract();

// Use the Read method to convert TIFF to PDF
ocr.Read(@"path\to\your\file.tiff").SaveAsSearchablePdf(@"path\to\output\file.pdf");
```

This concise example demonstrates the ease with which developers can incorporate high-level OCR functions into their .NET applications, enhancing the value of the software solutions they provide .
