The `IronTesseract` C# class from Iron Software adeptly facilitates the conversion of TIFF images into searchable PDF documents. Harnessing optical character recognition (OCR) technology, `IronTesseract` offers a straightforward approach to transform these images into fully searchable and editable text formats ideal for data storage, retrieval, and management.

To begin the process, first ensure that `IronOcr` is installed in your development environment. You can do this simply by executing the NuGet package manager command:

```bash
PM> Install-Package IronOcr
```

Once installed, you can create an instance of the `IronTesseract` class and use it to read TIFF images and convert them into PDF format as shown in the following code snippet:

```csharp
using IronOcr;

var ocr = new IronTesseract();
using (var input = new OcrInput("path/to/your/image.tiff"))
{
    var result = ocr.Read(input);
    result.SaveAsSearchablePdf("output/path/your_output.pdf");
}
```

This example illustrates the initialization of the `IronTesseract` object, loading the TIFF image, and processing it to create a searchable PDF formatted file at the specified location. The resultant PDF will contain text that is fully searchable, making it perfect for applications that need to extract and utilize textual data from scanned documents.
