The `IronTesseract` class from Iron Software is crafted specifically for .NET developers, facilitating the seamless conversion of TIFF images into searchable PDF files. This functionality is crucial for implementing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities within C# applications, allowing businesses and individuals to digitize and index large volumes of archival content efficiently.

```csharp
// Install the necessary package via NuGet
// PM> Install-Package IronOcr

using IronOcr;

var Ocr = new IronTesseract();

// Set up the input TIFF file and output PDF file paths
string inputPath = @"path\to\your\file.tif";
string outputPath = @"path\to\your\output.pdf";

// Configure the OCR engine to read from TIFF and output as PDF
Ocr.Read(inputPath).SaveAsSearchablePdf(outputPath);

```
