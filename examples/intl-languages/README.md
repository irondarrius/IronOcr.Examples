IronOCR offers support for 125 international languages.

Beyond English, which is pre-installed, additional language packs can be integrated into your .NET project either through the NuGet package manager or by downloading them from our [Languages Page](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/languages/).

You can choose from three quality levels for most languages: Fast, Standard (which is recommended), and Best. The Best quality setting, while offering higher accuracy, will operate more slowly.
