IronOCR offers support for 125 global languages.

Apart from English, which comes pre-installed, additional language packs can be incorporated into your .NET projects through NuGet or by downloading from our [Languages Page](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/languages/).

These languages are accessible in three quality tiers: Fast, Standard (which is the suggested option), and Best. While the Best quality setting likely enhances accuracy, it also requires more processing time.
