IronOCR offers support for 125 different international languages.

Besides English, which is already included by default, additional language packs can be incorporated into your .NET project either through NuGet or by downloading them from our [Languages Page](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/languages/).

These languages are accessible in three qualities: Fast, Standard (which is recommended), and Best. While the Best quality option tends to be more precise, it is also the slowest.
