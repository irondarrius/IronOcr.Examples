Iron Tesseract adeptly handles numerous image formats and PDF documents. This capability sets it apart from typical free Tesseract engines.

`OcrInput` allows for automatic corrections of PDF attributes in the event of low-quality scans.

Developers can choose to process an entire PDF, select specific pages, or focus on a particular cropped area.

## C# PDF OCR

While many OCR tools perform adequately under ideal conditions, IronOCR excels by delivering robust and accurate text extraction under varied circumstances.

IronOCR is engineered from the ground up to convert real-world images into text with near-perfect accuracy of 99 percent.

Our `IronTesseract` library—native to C#—emulates near-human character recognition from images that may not always be of high quality or properly aligned.

This OCR capability also extends to automatic adjustments for images or PDFs derived from subpar scans.
