Iron Tesseract possesses the capability to process various image formats as well as PDF documents, a feature not found in standard free Tesseract implementations. 

Using the `OcrInput` class, you can allow automatic enhancements to PDFs if the scans are of poor quality. 

Developers have the flexibility to either process an entire PDF, select specific pages, or just focus on a cropped area within the document.

## C# PDF OCR

While many OCR tools perform adequately under ideal conditions, IronOCR excels by providing stability and accuracy even in challenging environments.

IronOCR, engineered specifically for text extraction, boasts a 99 percent accuracy rate in converting images from the real world.

Our native C# OCR library, `IronTesseract`, emulates near-human accuracy in recognizing characters from real-life images that may be of subpar quality or off-angle.

The OCR technology in IronOCR automatically improves the characteristics of images or PDFs if the original scans are low-quality.

This walkthrough will showcase why IronOCR stands as the premier OCR solution currently on the market.
