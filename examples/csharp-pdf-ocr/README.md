Iron Tesseract excels in the OCR field by handling a variety of image formats and PDF documents, a capability that traditional free Tesseract engines do not offer.

Using `OcrInput`, developers can elect to automatically correct PDF characteristics if the scans are of low quality.

Furthermore, it offers flexibility to process an entire PDF, select specific pages, or focus on a particular crop area.

## C# PDF OCR

In the realm of OCR technology, IronOCR is renowned for its robust performance and accuracy, functioning reliably under diverse conditions. IronOCR leverages a cutting-edge approach, translating real-world images into text with up to 99% accuracy.

Our `IronTesseract` library, a purely C# based OCR solution, is adept at interpreting text from images that may not be of the highest quality, recognizing characters in a manner akin to human perception.

Altogether, IronOCR enhances the characteristics of both images and PDFs automatically for scans that do not meet quality standards.

## Customize IronOCR’s Performance to Suit Your Needs

Iron Software's OCR solution allows you to tailor the OCR performance to achieve the ideal balance in your workflow. A key attribute influencing the OCR speed is the image quality; generally, a cleaner and higher dpi image (around 200 dpi) yields faster and more accurate results. However, IronOCR’s performance tuning feature ensures that even tasks involving low-quality images are processed quickly.

Selecting image formats like PNG or TIFF, which typically have less digital noise than JPEG, can also enhance the outcome.
