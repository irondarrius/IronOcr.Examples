This illustration shows an enhancement in processing speed by over 35% compared to the standard configuration, with only a negligible 0.2% decrease in accuracy.

Furthermore, you might find it useful to explore how to [perform OCR on a designated area of an image](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/examples/net-tesseract-content-area-rectangle-crop/), which can also greatly enhance processing speeds.

IronOCR can be obtained via NuGet or downloaded as a [DLL file](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/downloads/tesseract-ocr-speed.zip) directly.
