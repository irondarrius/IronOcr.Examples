The `IronTesseract` class offers an `OcrProgress` event, which serves to monitor the progress of OCR operations. This event leverages the `OcrProgressEventArgs` object, which is triggered after the completion of text reading for each page.

This feature proves beneficial across various application types such as graphical user interface applications, web applications, and command-line interfaces, by providing users with updates on the expected time remaining.
