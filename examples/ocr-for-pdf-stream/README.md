IronOCR is also compatible with Stream objects.

In the illustrated scenario, IronPDF is employed to generate a PDF Stream which is subsequently utilized by IronOCR for text recognition.

It is important to highlight that while IronOCR is capable of accepting Stream objects as input, it does not facilitate the exporting of Stream objects as output files.
