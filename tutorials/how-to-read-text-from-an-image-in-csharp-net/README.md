IronOCR Basic Demonstration

In this straightforward demonstration, we will assess how accurately the IronOCR C# library can interpret text from a PNG image. This test is elementary, yet as we progress, the complexity will increase.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
```

While the process might appear straightforward, beneath the surface, it involves complex actions: the system scans the image, evaluating its alignment, quality, and resolution. It also assesses the image's attributes, refines the OCR engine's performance, and employs a sophisticated artificial intelligence system to interpret the text in a manner akin to human reading.

OCR is inherently a complex task for a computer, often processing at a speed comparable to human reading. It is not an instantaneous technology; however, in this instance, the result is impressively accurate, achieving a 100% accuracy rate.

## Enhanced Capabilities of IronOCR Tesseract for C#

In practical development scenarios, achieving optimal performance is crucial. For such applications, it's advisable to utilize the `OcrInput` and `IronTesseract` classes from the `IronOcr` library, ensuring top-tier functionality for your projects.

### Features of `OcrInput`

`OcrInput` allows developers to fine-tune the OCR process by providing control over various parameters including:

- Compatibility with a broad range of image formats such as JPEG, TIFF, GIF, BMP, and PNG.
- Capability to incorporate entire documents or specific sections from PDFs.
- Tools to improve image quality such as enhancing contrast, resolution, and size.
- Corrections for common image issues like rotation, scan noise, digital artifacts, skew, and inverted colors.

### Capabilities of `IronTesseract`

`IronTesseract` extends the functionality with robust features such as:

- Selection from an extensive array of pre-configured languages and dialects.
- Immediate usage of different versions of Tesseract OCR engines, including Tesseract 5, 4, and 3.
- Ability to define the nature of the document being processed, whether it’s a simple screenshot, a detailed snippet, or an entire file.
- Functionality to decode barcodes integrated within documents.
- Diverse output options including Searchable PDFs, Hocr HTML, DOM, and plain text Strings.

These advanced features are designed to harness the full potential of IronOCR, making it a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate sophisticated OCR capabilities into their applications.

### Initial Setup with OcrInput and IronTesseract

While the process might initially appear complex, the following example demonstrates the default configurations recommended for your first use of IronOCR. These settings are generally effective for processing a wide range of image types.

```cs
// Import the required classes from IronOcr library
using IronOcr;

// Create an instance of IronTesseract class
IronTesseract tesseractOcr = new IronTesseract();

// Initialize OcrInput to process OCR
using (OcrInput processingInput = new OcrInput())
{
    int[] targetPages = new int[] { 1, 2 };  // Specify the pages to be processed
    processingInput.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.tiff", targetPages);  // Load specific frames from a TIFF image

    // Execute OCR and store the results
    OcrResult ocrResult = tesseractOcr.Read(processingInput);
    Console.WriteLine(ocrResult.Text);  // Output the text extracted from the image
}
```

IronTesseract is robust enough to handle medium quality scans and still deliver perfect accuracy, achieving a 100% successful OCR rate.

<br>

<a href='/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.tiff' target="_blank">
<img src="/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.thumb.png" alt="C# OCR Scan From Tiff Example"  class="img-responsive add-shadow img-margin" style="max-height:250px; border:1px solid gray"  >
</a>
</center>

As demonstrated, extracting text (and even barcodes) from scanned TIFF images can be done with relative ease using IronOCR.

The OCR process resulted in an impressive accuracy rate of **100%**.

While OCR technology may not always deliver perfect results with real-world documents, IronTesseract approaches this ideal as closely as possible.

Additionally, IronOCR seamlessly handles multi-page documents like TIFF files and can even [extract text from PDF documents](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/use-case/pdf-ocr-csharp/) automatically.

### Example: Enhancing OCR Accuracy for Low-Resolution Scans

In this section, we'll explore how well IronOCR performs with scans that are of much lower quality — typified by low resolution, significant distortions, and noticeable digital noise. This scenario often represents a considerable challenge for many OCR solutions.

<br>
<center>
<a href='https://ironsoftware.com/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.LowQuality.tiff' target="_blank">
<img src="https://ironsoftware.com/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.LowQualitythumb.png" alt="C# OCR Low Resolution Scan with Digital Noise"  class="img-responsive add-shadow img-margin" style="max-height:250px; border:1px solid gray"  >
</a>
</center>

Here, we tackle a significantly degraded version of the same page scan, suffering from low DPI and extensive digital damage. This is where the capabilities of IronOCR shine, distinguishing it from other products that might shy away from the challenge of real-world, imperfect document scans.

```cs
using IronOcr;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
var pageindices = new int[] { 1, 2 };
input.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.LowQuality.tiff", pageindices);
input.Deskew(); // Automatically corrects image skew and perspective
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);
Console.WriteLine(result.Text);
```

Initially, an OCR operation on such an image without any preprocessing yields an accuracy of 52.5%, which isn't satisfactory. By applying the `Input.Deskew()` filter, IronOCR enhances the scan orientation, improving accuracy remarkably to **99.8%** — nearly replicating the results of a high-quality scan.

These image filters do take some additional processing time but are often worth the investment for the significant improvement in OCR accuracy they provide. Should there be considerable digital noise in your input images, you might want to consider using `Input.DeNoise()`, a filter designed to clean up the noise effectively.

For developers looking to optimize OCR operations under diverse conditions, these filters are crucial tools in their arsenal, enabling them to handle a wide range of document qualities efficiently.

<br>
<center>
<a href='/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.LowQuality.tiff' target="_blank">
<img src="/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.LowQualitythumb.png" alt="C# OCR Low Resolution Scan with Digital Noise"  class="img-responsive add-shadow img-margin" style="max-height:250px; border:1px solid gray"  >
</a>
</center>

Next, we will evaluate IronOCR's performance with a lower quality scan of the same document. This particular scan has a significantly reduced DPI and exhibits considerable distortions including digital noise and physical damage to the paper.

**It is in these challenging conditions that IronOCR distinguishes itself from other OCR libraries like Tesseract.** While other OCR tools might avoid such complex real-world scenarios, IronOCR excels in accurately interpreting text from images that are far from perfect, bypassing the idealized conditions often used in tests to achieve flawless OCR results.

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Instantiate IronTesseract to start OCR operations.
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Using OcrInput to manage our images and OCR process.
using OcrInput imageInput = new OcrInput();
int[] pageIndexes = { 1, 2 };  // Defining pages for OCR.

// Load specific frames from a low-quality TIFF image.
imageInput.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.LowQuality.tiff", pageIndexes);

// Adjust the image to align it correctly before processing.
imageInput.Deskew();  // Corrects any skew in the image.

// Perform OCR on the input and derive results.
OcrResult ocrResults = ocrEngine.Read(imageInput);

// Output the result as text.
Console.WriteLine(ocrResults.Text);
```

Neglecting to apply the `Input.Deskew()` results in an OCR accuracy of only 52.5%, which is suboptimal.

However, introducing `Input.Deskew()` enhances that accuracy dramatically to **99.8%**, almost reaching the precision of scanning a high-quality document.

While image filters may slightly delay processing, they significantly improve the OCR's efficiency. It's essential for developers to familiarize themselves with the specifics of their documents to optimize processing times effectively.

For uncertain cases:
- Employing `Input.Deskew()` is highly effective and dependable.
- For substantial digital noise, consider using `Input.DeNoise()` to enhance clarity.

## Optimization Techniques for OCR Performance

The highest determinant of OCR processing speed is unquestionably the condition of the source image. Ideally, images with minimal background noise and higher dpi settings, specifically around 200 dpi, ensure quicker and more precise OCR outcomes.

Nevertheless, precision comes with the cost of computation. While IronOCR excels at enhancing less-than-ideal documents, this enhancement can be resource-intensive and may ultimately increase the processing time and CPU usage.

To optimize performance further, it’s advisable to choose image formats that inherently possess less noise. Formats like TIFF or PNG are typically superior as they avoid the artefacts commonly found in lossy compression formats like JPEG. This strategic selection can measurably speed up the OCR processing.

#### Image Processing Filters for Enhanced OCR Performance

Here are some essential image processing filters designed to significantly optimize OCR performance:

- **`OcrInput.Rotate(double degrees)`** - Allows you to rotate the image by a specified degree clockwise. For rotation in the opposite direction, specify negative values.
- **`OcrInput.Binarize()`** - Converts each pixel to either black or white, eliminating grayscale. This is particularly useful in enhancing OCR accuracy in images where the text contrast to the background is very low.
- **`OcrInput.ToGrayScale()`** - Converts the image into grayscale. This may not necessarily enhance accuracy but is known to potentially boost processing speed.
- **`OcrInput.Contrast()`** - Automatically enhances the contrast of the image, frequently leading to improved speed and accuracy in scans with initially low contrast.
- **`OcrInput.DeNoise()`** - Effective in removing digital noise from images. It is recommended to use this filter only when noise is clearly impacting image quality.
- **`OcrInput.Invert()`** - Inverts the colors in the image (i.e., black turns to white and vice versa), which can be useful depending on the image background and text colors.
- **`OcrInput.Dilate()`** - A sophisticated morphology filter, dilation adds pixels to the edges of objects within an image, enhancing visibility and distinctiveness at the boundaries.
- **`OcrInput.Erode()`** - Another advanced morphology filter, erosion reduces pixels along the boundaries of objects, creating a contrasting effect to dilation.
- **`OcrInput.Deskew()`** - Adjusts the alignment of the image to ensure it is perfectly horizontal and vertical, which is crucial as the Tesseract engine has limited tolerance for skewed images.
- **`OcrInput.DeepCleanBackgroundNoise()`** - This intensive filter is best used when images have significant background noise that might interfere with OCR accuracy. Note: this filter is processor intensive and can reduce readability in cleaner documents.
- **`OcrInput.EnhanceResolution()`** - Improves the resolution of images that start with low quality. Less frequently needed since `OcrInput.MinimumDPI` and `OcrInput.TargetDPI` settings usually auto-correct these issues by default.

### Optimizing OCR Processing Speed with Iron Tesseract

When utilizing Iron Tesseract, you may be inclined to enhance the processing speed, particularly with scans of superior quality.

To achieve a speed-optimized configuration, start with a basic setup, and progressively enable additional features to strike an ideal balance between speed and accuracy.

Here's the paraphrased section with all relative URLs resolved to `ironsoftware.com`:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize IronTesseract
IronTesseract tesseract = new IronTesseract();

// Optimize settings for faster processing
tesseract.Configuration.BlackListCharacters = "~`$#^*_}{][\\";
tesseract.Configuration.PageSegmentationMode = TesseractPageSegmentationMode.Auto;
tesseract.Language = OcrLanguage.EnglishFast;

// Prepare the image input
using OcrInput inputConfiguration = new OcrInput();
int[] targetedPages = new int[] { 1, 2 };
inputConfiguration.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.tiff", targetedPages);

// Perform OCR and get the result
OcrResult ocrResult = tesseract.Read(inputConfiguration);
Console.WriteLine(ocrResult.Text);
```

This outcome achieves an accuracy of **99.8%**, slightly less than the baseline of **100%**, yet it delivers a 35% improvement in speed.

## Focusing on Specific Image Sections for OCR

In the example below, you'll see how Iron Software's adaptation of Tesseract OCR excels at interpreting precise segments of images.

We leverage the `System.Drawing.Rectangle` to designate, in pixel dimensions, the specific region of an image for OCR processing.

This capability is particularly beneficial for standardized documents—like forms—where only specific text areas vary and require extraction.

### Example: Targeted Document Scanning

By leveraging the `System.Drawing.Rectangle` class, we can define a precise area of an image to perform OCR. The dimensions are specified in **pixels**.

This method not only accelerates the OCR process but also prevents the inclusion of irrelevant text. For instance, in this example, we extract just a student's name from a specified section of a standard form.

using (OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput())
{
    // Define the rectangle area that OCR will focus on
    Rectangle areaOfInterest = new Rectangle(x: 215, y: 1250, height: 280, width: 1335);

    // Load the specific part of the image defined by the rectangle for OCR processing
    ocrInput.LoadImage("https://ironsoftware.com/img/ComSci.png", areaOfInterest);

    // Perform the OCR operation and read the text
    OcrResult ocrText = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);

    // Output the extracted text to the console
    Console.WriteLine(ocrText.Text);
}
```

This results in a remarkable 41% enhancement in processing speed, which proves invaluable for _.NET OCR_ applications involving consistent document types like Invoices, Receipts, Checks, Forms, and Expense Claims.

Content Area-specific OCR (cropping) support extends to PDFs, further enhancing functionality.

OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input); // Execute OCR process

// Windows console has limitations displaying Arabic directly
// Therefore, save the output to a text file
result.SaveAsTextFile("arabic.txt"); // Save OCR result as a text file
```

### Example: Multilingual OCR Scanning

In this example, we demonstrate how to perform OCR on documents containing text in several languages simultaneously.

Frequently, documents like a Chinese text may include sections in English including URLs. This capability to handle multiple languages in a single OCR task is extremely useful in such contexts.

```shell
PM> Install-Package IronOcr.Languages.ChineseSimplified
```

Here's a paraphrased version of the provided section of the article:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize IronTesseract with the primary OCR language
IronTesseract ocrInstance = new IronTesseract();
ocrInstance.Language = OcrLanguage.ChineseSimplified;

// Additional languages can be incorporated as needed
ocrInstance.AddSecondaryLanguage(OcrLanguage.English);
// Custom Tesseract data can be included by specifying the file path

// Load and process the image for OCR
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();
ocrInput.LoadImage("https://ironsoftware.com/img/MultiLanguage.jpeg");
OcrResult ocrResult = ocrInstance.Read(ocrInput);

// Store the OCR results as a text file
ocrResult.SaveAsTextFile("MultiLanguage.txt");
```

## Handling Multi-Page Documents

IronOcr is proficient at amalgamating several pages or images into a unified `OcrResult`. This capability is particularly advantageous for documents compiled from multiple images. As we'll explore further, this distinctive attribute of IronTesseract is instrumental in generating searchable PDFs and HTML files based on OCR data.

IronOcr allows for flexible integration of different file types like images, TIFF frames, and PDF pages into a single OCR input, enhancing the versatility of document processing.

Here is a paraphrased version of the given code section:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize the IronTesseract class
IronTesseract tesseractOCR = new IronTesseract();

// Create a new OcrInput instance to manage OCR input
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();
// Load individual images to be processed
ocrInput.LoadImage("image1.jpeg");
ocrInput.LoadImage("image2.png");
// Specify the page indices to load frames from an animated GIF
int[] indices = { 1, 2 };
ocrInput.LoadImageFrames("image3.gif", indices);

// Execute the OCR process
OcrResult ocrOutcome = tesseractOCR.Read(ocrInput);

// Output the number of pages processed
Console.WriteLine($"{ocrOutcome.Pages.Length} Pages"); // Output: 3 Pages
```

```cs
using IronOcr;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();

using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
var pageIndices = new int[] { 1, 2 };
input.LoadImageFrames("MultiFrame.Tiff", pageIndices);
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);

Console.WriteLine(result.Text);
Console.WriteLine($"{result.Pages.Length} Pages");
// 1 page for every frame (page) in the TIFF
```

```cs
// Utilizing IronOcr for Optical Character Recognition

using IronOcr;

// Initialize the IronTesseract object to handle OCR operations
IronTesseract tesseractOCR = new IronTesseract();

// Preparing input for OCR using the OcrInput class
using OcrInput scanningInput = new OcrInput();
int[] indicesToProcess = { 1, 2 }; // Define TIFF frame indices to process
scanningInput.LoadImageFrames("MultiFrame.Tiff", indicesToProcess);
// Running OCR on the input frames
OcrResult ocrOutcome = tesseractOCR.Read(scanningInput);

// Output the extracted text
Console.WriteLine(ocrOutcome.Text);
// Display the total number of processed pages (each frame is treated as a page)
Console.WriteLine($"{ocrOutcome.Pages.Length} Pages");
// From each frame in the TIFF, one page of OCR result is generated
```

Here's the paraphrased section of the article with resolved relative URL paths:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Instantiating the IronTesseract class
IronTesseract tesseract = new IronTesseract();
using (OcrInput inputConfig = new OcrInput())
{
    // Loading a password-protected PDF to process OCR
    inputConfig.LoadPdf("example.pdf", Password: "password");
    // Optionally, PDF pages can be explicitly specified here for OCR

    // Performing the OCR process on the input PDF
    OcrResult ocrOutput = tesseract.Read(inputConfig);

    // Displaying the OCR results and the number of pages processed
    Console.WriteLine(ocrOutput.Text);
    Console.WriteLine($"{ocrOutput.Pages.Length} Pages");
    // Outputs the number of pages in the OCR result, one for each PDF page
}
```

## Generating Searchable PDFs

One of the standout features of IronOCR is its ability to produce searchable PDFs from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) results, a feature that is highly valued in C# and VB.NET applications. This functionality is particularly beneficial for populating databases, enhancing search engine optimization, and improving the usability of PDFs across various industries, including business sectors and government institutions.

Here is the paraphrased section of the article:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Prepare the OCR input with various images
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput() { Title = "Quarterly Report" };
ocrInput.LoadImage("image1.jpeg");
ocrInput.LoadImage("image2.png");
int[] frameIndices = new int[] { 1, 2 };
ocrInput.LoadImageFrames("image3.gif", frameIndices);

// Execute OCR and read results
OcrResult ocrResults = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);
// Save the results into a searchable PDF file
ocrResults.SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable.pdf");
```

Here's the paraphrased section requested:

Another helpful feature of OCR technology is transforming a pre-existing PDF document into a searchable format.

Here's a paraphrased version of the specified section from the article, with URL paths resolved to "ironsoftware.com":

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Create an instance of IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Create and configure OcrInput with PDF document
using (OcrInput inputSettings = new OcrInput())
{
    inputSettings.Title = "Pdf Metadata Name";
    inputSettings.LoadPdf("example.pdf", Password: "password"); // Load a password-protected PDF

    // Perform OCR processing on the loaded PDF
    OcrResult ocrOutput = ocrEngine.Read(inputSettings);

    // Save the OCR results as a searchable PDF
    ocrOutput.SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable.pdf");
}
```

Converting multi-page TIFF documents to searchable PDFs is similarly streamlined using IronTesseract. This functionality applies to TIFF files containing one or more pages.

```cs
// Importing the necessary IronOCR namespace
using IronOcr;

// Creating an instance of IronTesseract for OCR operations
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Configuring OCR input with specific settings
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();
ocrInput.Title = "Pdf Title";
int[] desiredPages = new int[] { 1, 2 };

// Loading specific TIFF image frames for OCR
ocrInput.LoadImageFrames("example.tiff", desiredPages);

// Performing the OCR operation on loaded images
OcrResult ocrResult = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);

// Saving the OCR result as a searchable PDF
ocrResult.SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable.pdf");
```

## Hocr HTML Export

IronOCR enables the exportation of OCR results into Hocr HTML format. This format is essentially an XML document that can be analyzed using XML readers or styled into attractive HTML layouts.

This functionality facilitates limited conversions from **PDF to HTML** and **TIFF to HTML**, enhancing document accessibility and usability.

```cs
// Incorporating IronOcr for advanced text extraction

using IronOcr;

// Initialize IronTesseract - the core of IronOCR
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Creating an instance of OcrInput to manage OCR tasks
using OcrInput imageDocument = new OcrInput();
imageDocument.Title = "Html Title";

// Expanding the content scope as needed
imageDocument.LoadImage("https://ironsoftware.com/image2.jpeg");

## Extracting Barcodes with IronOCR

IronOCR stands out from conventional Tesseract implementations by also providing the capability to read barcodes and QR codes. This enhanced functionality sets IronOCR apart, enabling it to handle a broader range of document processing tasks more effectively.

Here's the paraphrased section of the article, with relative URL paths resolved:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize IronTesseract OCR with barcode reading feature enabled
IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
ocr.Configuration.ReadBarCodes = true;

// Create OcrInput and load an image designated for extracting barcode data
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
input.LoadImage("https://ironsoftware.com/img/Barcode.png");

// Execute OCR to read the barcodes from loaded image
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);

// Iterate through the detected barcodes and output their values
foreach (var barcode in result.Barcodes)
{
    Console.WriteLine(barcode.Value);
    // Each barcode object contains additional details like type and spatial location
}
``` 

This revised code continues to illustrate the process of barcode detection using IronOCR, ensuring the loaded image is readily recognized for any barcode content.

## In-Depth Analysis of OCR Output in .NET

As we conclude this guide, let's dive into the rich details provided by the OCR results when using IronOCR. While the primary objective is often to extract text, IronOCR delivers an extensive suite of data that can be valuable for developers who need more in-depth analysis.

The OCR results are encapsulated in an object that includes multiple pages. Each page can contain various elements such as barcodes, textual lines, words, characters, and even illustrative graphs. These elements are not merely textual; they include detailed metadata including their respective locations based on X and Y coordinates, dimensions (width and height), and associated images which can be further examined. Additionally, the textual content is richer with metadata such as font details, text direction, text rotation, and IronOCR’s confidence level in the accuracy of the recognized text for that specific segment.

This wealth of information opens up opportunities for developers to creatively manipulate and utilize OCR data beyond simple text extraction. Whether it's refining the data presentation or integrating OCR data with other functionalities, the flexibility is significant.

Furthermore, developers can selectively export various elements such as paragraphs, words, or barcodes, either as images or bitmaps, directly from the OCR Results object. This functionality enhances the adaptability of IronOCR in diverse .NET applications, catering to both basic and advanced OCR requirements.

```cs
using IronOcr;
using IronSoftware.Drawing;

// Explore the OCR results as a structured object model consisting of pages, barcodes, paragraphs, lines, words, and characters
// This structure allows further manipulation, exportation, and graphical representation using additional programming interfaces.

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
ocr.Configuration.ReadBarCodes = true;

using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
var pageIndexes = new int[] { 1, 2 };
input.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.tiff", pageIndexes);

OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);

foreach (var page in result.Pages)
{
    // Accessing page details
    int pageNumber = page.PageNumber;
    string pageText = page.Text;
    int pageWordCount = page.WordCount;

    // Barcodes collection can be empty if barcodes are not set to be read
    OcrResult.Barcode[] barcodes = page.Barcodes;

    // Bitmap representation of the page
    AnyBitmap pageImage = page.ToBitmap(input);
    System.Drawing.Bitmap pageImageLegacy = page.ToBitmap(input);
    int pageWidth = page.Width;
    int pageHeight = page.Height;

    foreach (var paragraph in page.Paragraphs)
    {
        // Digging into paragraphs within the page
        int paragraphNumber = paragraph.ParagraphNumber;
        string paragraphText = paragraph.Text;
        System.Drawing.Bitmap paragraphImage = paragraph.ToBitmap(input);
        int paragraphX = paragraph.X;
        int paragraphY = paragraph.Y;
        int paragraphWidth = paragraph.Width;

            int lineNumber = line.LineNumber;
            string lineText = line.Text;
            AnyBitmap lineImage = line.ToBitmap(input);

                int wordNumber = word.WordNumber;
                string wordText = word.Text;
                AnyBitmap wordImage = word.ToBitmap(input);

                double wordConfidence = word.Confidence;

                if (word.Font != null)
                {
                    // Conditional font details if they are set
                    string fontName = word.Font.FontName;
                    double fontSize = word.Font.FontSize;
                    bool isBold = word.Font.IsBold;
                    bool isFixedWidth = word.Font.IsFixedWidth;
                    bool isItalic = word.Font.IsItalic;

                    bool isCaligraphic = word.Font.IsCaligraphic;
                }

                foreach (var character in word.Characters)
                {
                    // Examining characters in a word
                    int characterNumber = character.CharacterNumber;
                    string characterText = character.Text;

                    OcrResult.Choice[] characterChoices = character.Choices;
                }
