### Example: Initial Setup with OcrInput and IronTesseract

The process might appear complex at first, but the following example demonstrates the recommended default settings to begin with, which are effective for processing nearly any type of image using IronOCR.

```cs
// Include the required namespace for optical character recognition
using IronOcr;

// Instantiate the IronTesseract class
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();

// Define the indices of the pages you want to read from the TIFF image
var pageIndexes = new int[] { 1, 2 };

// Load specific frames from a TIFF image located at the given path
ocrInput.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.tiff", pageIndexes);

// Perform the OCR process on the loaded image frames
OcrResult ocrResults = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);

// Output the text extracted from the image
Console.WriteLine(ocrResults.Text);
```

IronTesseract is capable of delivering 100% accurate OCR results, even on medium-quality scans.

<img src="/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.thumb.png" alt="C# OCR Scan From Tiff Example"  class="img-responsive add-shadow img-margin" style="max-height:250px; border:1px solid gray"  >
</a>
</center>

As illustrated, effortlessly extracting text (and barcodes, if needed) from a TIFF image scan is straightforward and remarkably precise.

Achieving an impressive accuracy level of **100%**, this OCR task demonstrates the effectiveness of the technology.

While OCR technology isn't flawless for all real-world documents, IronTesseract approaches the pinnacle of what's achievable.

Moreover, IronOCR is adept at handling multi-page documents like TIFFs and can even seamlessly [extract text from PDF documents](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/use-case/pdf-ocr-csharp/) without manual intervention.

### Example: Handling Low-Quality Scans

In this section, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of IronOCR in managing scans of inferior quality. These scans often come from pages with significant distortion, digital noise, or damage.

**IronOCR excels in these challenging scenarios, setting it apart from other OCR tools**, which typically hesitate to tackle such difficult cases. Other OCR solutions often use ideal, digitally-created images for showcasing their accuracy, avoiding the complexities presented by real-world documents.

```cs
using IronOcr;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
var pageIndices = new int[] { 1, 2 };
input.LoadImageFrames(@"img/Potter.LowQuality.tiff", pageIndices);
input.Deskew(); // Corrects rotation and perspective issues
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);
Console.WriteLine(result.Text);
```

Initially, without applying the `Input.Deskew()` method, the OCR accuracy stands at 52.5%—not exceptionally helpful. However, once we employ `Input.Deskew()`, the accuracy leaps to **99.8%**, nearly matching that of a high-quality scan.

Image filters can be a bit slow to run but can also significantly expedite the OCR processing time. Striking the right balance is key:

- **`Input.Deskew()`** is a reliable and very effective filter.
- **`Input.DeNoise()`** can be considered if there is substantial digital noise.

<center>
<a href='https://ironsoftware.com/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.LowQuality.tiff' target="_blank">
<img src="https://ironsoftware.com/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.LowQualitythumb.png" alt="C# OCR Low Resolution Scan with Digital Noise"  class="img-responsive add-shadow img-margin" style="max-height:250px; border:1px solid gray">
</a>
</center>

IronOCR is not merely adept at decoding well-formed text; its real prowess is evident in its ability to meticulously process and extract text from poorly scanned and low-quality documents. More than just an OCR tool, IronOCR brings a rigor that stands tall in face of real-world document challenges.

<br>
<center>
<a href='/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.LowQuality.tiff' target="_blank">
<img src="/img/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/Potter.LowQualitythumb.png" alt="C# OCR Low Resolution Scan with Digital Noise"  class="img-responsive add-shadow img-margin" style="max-height:250px; border:1px solid gray"  >
</a>
</center>

Now, let's experiment with a scan of significantly inferior quality, characterized by a low DPI, considerable image distortion, digital noise, and damage to the physical document.

**IronOCR excels in situations like these, unlike other OCR libraries, including Tesseract**, which often avoid discussing performance under less-than-ideal conditions. IronOCR is adept at handling real-world images that are far from perfect, as opposed to digitally-created images designed to showcase flawless OCR capabilities.

```cs
// Importing the necessary IronOCR namespace
using IronOcr;

// Creating the Iron Tesseract OCR instance
IronTesseract ironTesseractInstance = new IronTesseract();

// Initializing the OcrInput object to handle OCR operations
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();

// Specifying the indices of the pages to be processed
int[] pagesToProcess = new int[] { 1, 2 };
ocrInput.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.LowQuality.tiff", pagesToProcess);

// Applying deskew method to correct the image alignment
ocrInput.Deskew();

// Executing the OCR process
OcrResult ocrOutput = ironTesseractInstance.Read(ocrInput);

// Outputting the extracted text to the console
Console.WriteLine(ocrOutput.Text);
```

Without implementing the `Input.Deskew()` method to correct the image orientation, the accuracy stands at 52.5%, which is insufficient.

However, by applying the `Input.Deskew()` method, the accuracy remarkably increases to **99.8%**, nearly matching the OCR accuracy achievable with high-quality scans.

Although image filters can slightly prolong processing time, they generally help reduce the overall OCR read time. It's important for developers to familiarize themselves with the characteristics of their documents to find the right balance.

For those uncertain about which filters to apply:

- `Input.Deskew()` is highly effective and reliable for correcting image alignment.
- As a secondary measure, `Input.DeNoise()` can be used to significantly reduce digital noise.

## Optimizing OCR Performance

The primary determinant of OCR processing speed is the quality of the input image. Minimizing background noise and aiming for a resolution around 200 dpi will enhance both the speed and accuracy of OCR results.

While optimal image quality facilitates faster processing, IronOCR excels in handling less-than-perfect document scans—however, be aware that this can increase processing time and consume more CPU resources.

For better performance, it's advisable to select image formats like TIFF or PNG, which maintain quality without adding noise, over 'lossy' formats like JPEG which may degrade the image and slow down OCR processing.

#### Image Enhancement Filters for Optimizing OCR

Listed below are several image enhancement filters that can significantly bolster OCR performance:

- **`OcrInput.Rotate(double degrees)`** - This function rotates the image by the specified degrees. To rotate counterclockwise, simply input a negative value.
  
- **`OcrInput.Binarize()`** - Converts each pixel to either black or white, eliminating shades of gray. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where text contrast against the background is very low.

- **`OcrInput.ToGrayScale()`** - Converts the image to grayscale. Although this does not generally enhance OCR accuracy, it can lead to faster processing speeds.

- **`OcrInput.Contrast()`** - Automatically enhances the contrast of the image, which can frequently improve both the speed and accuracy of OCR in scans with low contrast.

- **`OcrInput.DeNoise()`** - Used to remove digital noise from images. This should be used when noise is a known issue within the image.

- **`OcrInput.Invert()`** - Inverts the colors within the image; for example, black becomes white and vice versa. This may assist OCR in certain contexts.

- **`OcrInput.Dilate()`** - An advanced morphological operation that increases the size of objects within the image by adding pixels at their boundaries. It is the opposite of the `Erode` function.

- **`OcrInput.Erode()`** - Another advanced morphology operation, this one reduces the size of objects by removing pixels along their edges, the reverse effect of `Dilate`.

- **`OcrInput.Deskew()`** - Straightens an image to a true vertical alignment, crucial for OCR as Tesseract's tolerance for skew can be limited to as little as 5 degrees.

- **`OcrInput.DeepCleanBackgroundNoise()`** - This intensive filter is used for removing significant background noise. It should be applied cautiously as it can diminish OCR accuracy in clean documents and is resource-intensive.

- **`OcrInput.EnhanceResolution()`** - Boosts the resolution of images that are initially of poor quality. This is generally unnecessary as `OcrInput.MinimumDPI` and `OcrInput.TargetDPI` settings automatically adjust low-resolution inputs as needed.

### Optimizing OCR Performance for Rapid Processing

Leveraging Iron Tesseract, developers often aim to enhance OCR processing speeds particularly on high-quality scans.

For optimal speed, begin with basic configurations and incrementally enable additional features until you achieve an ideal equilibrium between performance and accuracy.

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initialize IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Optimization for faster processing by configuring relevant settings
ocrEngine.Configuration.BlackListCharacters = "~`$#^*_}{][\\";
ocrEngine.Configuration.PageSegmentationMode = TesseractPageSegmentationMode.Auto;
ocrEngine.Language = OcrLanguage.EnglishFast;

// Create an OcrInput object and load specific image frames
using OcrInput imageInput = new OcrInput();
int[] selectedPages = { 1, 2 };
imageInput.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.tiff", selectedPages);

// Perform OCR operation and capture the result
OcrResult ocrResult = ocrEngine.Read(imageInput);
// Output the extracted text to console
Console.WriteLine(ocrResult.Text);
```

This outcome achieves a **99.8%** accuracy rate, which is slightly below the baseline of **100%**, yet it offers a significant speed increase of **35%**.

## Cropped Image Reading

The code example below highlights Iron's customized Tesseract OCR's capability to target and read specific sections of images effectively.

By employing a `System.Drawing.Rectangle`, we can precisely determine the area of the image we wish to analyze, specified in pixels.

This functionality proves exceptionally beneficial for processing standardized documents, such as forms, where only specific sections contain variable text.

### Example: Area-based Document Scanning

Utilizing the `System.Drawing.Rectangle` allows us to define a specific area within a document for OCR processing. This area is always defined in **pixels**.

This method not only enhances the processing speed but also helps in omitting non-essential text. As demonstrated here, we extract a student's name from a specified central region of a standard document.

Another clever application of OCR is transforming existing PDF documents into searchable files. This greatly aids in improving the accessibility and indexability of documents.

```cs
using IronOcr;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();

using OcrInput input = new OcrInput();
input.Title = "Pdf Metadata Name";
input.LoadPdf("https://ironsoftware.com/example.pdf", Password: "password");
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);
result.SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable.pdf");
```

This feature enhances the utility of PDF documents by allowing them to be readily searchable in databases, enhancing SEO, and improving usability for businesses and governments alike.

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initiate the IronTesseract object
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();

// Create a new OcrInput instance with specific document properties
using OcrInput document = new OcrInput() { Title = "Pdf Metadata Name" };
// Load a protected PDF into the OCR reader using a specified password
document.LoadPdf("example.pdf", Password: "password");

// Perform OCR on the loaded PDF and store the results
OcrResult ocrResult = ocrEngine.Read(document);

// Export the OCR results to a searchable PDF file
ocrResult.SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable.pdf");
```

IronTesseract also excels at transforming TIFF documents, whether single or multi-page, into fully text-searchable PDFs. This conversion process enhances document management by facilitating search and retrieval functionalities, making it particularly beneficial for archiving and e-discovery applications.

Here's the paraphrased section of the article, with relative URL paths resolved against ironsoftware.com:

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initializing IronTesseract and OcrInput classes for OCR functionality
IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();

// Setting a title for the document
ocrInput.Title = "Document Title";

// Specifying the indices of TIFF frames to be processed
int[] frameIndices = new int[] { 1, 2 };
ocrInput.LoadImageFrames("example.tiff", frameIndices);

// Perform OCR on the loaded frames
OcrResult ocrOutcome = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);

// Convert and save the OCR results as a searchable PDF file
ocrOutcome.SaveAsSearchablePdf("searchable-document.pdf");
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the IronOCR library to convert TIFF images into a searchable PDF document, providing a clear example of setting up the OCR process, specifying the frames to be read, and outputting the contents.

## Hocr HTML Export

OCR results can also be exported to Hocr HTML, an XML format that can be parsed using XML readers or transformed into attractive HTML layouts.

This capability facilitates conversions from **PDF to HTML** and **TIFF to HTML**, enhancing document accessibility and usability.

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Creating an instance of IronTesseract
IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();

// Preparing the input for OCR
using OcrInput input = new OcrInput("Html Title");  // Set the title for HOCR

// Load various documents into the OCR input
input.LoadImage("https://ironsoftware.com/image2.jpeg");  // Load an image
input.LoadPdf("https://ironsoftware.com/example.pdf", password: "password");  // Load a PDF with a password
input.LoadImageFrames("https://ironsoftware.com/example.tiff", new[] { 1, 2 });  // Load specific frames from a TIFF file

// Perform the OCR process
OcrResult result = ocr.Read(input);

// Save the OCR results as an HOCR file, which is a structured HTML format for OCR data
result.SaveAsHocrFile("hocr.html");
```

## Barcode Scanning Capabilities in OCR Documents

Unique to IronOCR, it distinguishes itself from classic OCR tools, such as Tesseract, by possessing the ability to scan both barcodes and QR codes effortlessly.

```cs
using IronOcr;

// Initializing a new instance of IronTesseract
IronTesseract tesseractOCR = new IronTesseract();

// Enable barcode reading functionality
tesseractOCR.Configuration.ReadBarCodes = true;

// Input for OCR
using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();
ocrInput.LoadImage("https://ironsoftware.com/img/Barcode.png");

// Perform the OCR operation
OcrResult ocrResult = tesseractOCR.Read(ocrInput);

// Iterate through detected barcodes and print their values
foreach (var barcode in ocrResult.Barcodes)
{
    Console.WriteLine(barcode.Value);
    // Demonstrates that the type and location properties are available
}
```

## Examining the Details of OCR Output

To conclude this guide, let's delve into the intricacies of the OCR result objects. When we process OCR, our primary aim is typically to extract text, yet IronOCR delivers a rich trove of data that could be immensely valuable for seasoned developers.

An OCR result object encompasses an array of pages that can be traversed. Each page may contain various elements such as barcodes, illustrations of power graphs, and arrays of text, words, and individual characters.

Each element within these pages holds detailed attributes including a specific location, X and Y coordinates, dimensions (width and height), and an associated image that can be reviewed. Additional details like the font type, font size, text direction, text rotation, and IronOCR's confidence level in the accuracy of each word, line, or paragraph are also available.

This comprehensive array of data provides a flexible platform for developers to engage creatively with the OCR data, enabling thorough inspection and manipulation of information.

Furthermore, any component of the .NET OCR Results object, including paragraphs, words, or barcodes, can be manipulated and exported as an Image or Bitmap. This capability enhances the adaptability and utility of IronOCR in handling and utilizing OCR data effectively.

```cs
using IronOcr;
using IronSoftware.Drawing;

// An in-depth exploration of OCR results, showcasing an object model framework including Pages, Barcodes, Paragraphs, Lines, Words, and Characters
// This approach facilitates the examination, exportation, and graphical manipulation of OCR content using additional software interfaces.

IronTesseract ocrEngine = new IronTesseract();
ocrEngine.Configuration.ReadBarCodes = true;

using OcrInput ocrInput = new OcrInput();
int[] pageIndexes = { 1, 2 };
ocrInput.LoadImageFrames(@"img\Potter.tiff", pageIndexes);

OcrResult ocrResult = ocrEngine.Read(ocrInput);

foreach (var page in ocrResult.Pages)
{
    // Extracted details for each page
    int currentPageNumber = page.PageNumber;
    string currentPageText = page.Text;
    int currentPageWordCount = page.WordCount;

    OcrResult.Barcode[] detectedBarcodes = page.Barcodes; // This is null unless barcodes reading is enabled in the configuration.

    AnyBitmap currentBitmap = page.ToBitmap(ocrInput);
    System.Drawing.Bitmap legacyBitmap = page.ToBitmap(ocrInput);
    double currentPageWidth = page.Width;
    double currentPageHeight = page.Height;

    foreach (var paragraph in page.Paragraphs)
    {
        // Delving into paragraphs in the page
        int currentParagraphNumber = paragraph.ParagraphNumber;

            String currentLineText = line.Text;
            AnyBitmap lineVisualRepresentation = line.ToBitmap(ocrInput);
            System.Drawing.Bitmap legacyLineBitmap = line.ToBitmap(ocrInput);
            int lineXPosition = line.X;

                double wordOcrAccuracy = word.Confidence;

                if (word.Font != null)
                {
                    // Font details are available only when certain engine modes are used
                    String fontName = word.Font.FontName;
                    double fontSize = word.Font.FontSize;
                    bool isBold = word.Font.IsBold;
                    bool isFixedWidth = word.Font.IsFixedWidth;
                    bool isItalic = word.Font.IsItalic;

                }

                foreach (var character in word.Characters)
                {
                    // Deep diving into characters of the word
                    int characterIndex = character.CharacterNumber;

                    double characterAccuracy = character.Confidence;

                    // Retrieve and output alternative symbol probabilities to aid in error correction or spell checking.
                    OcrResult.Choice[] characterAlternatives = character.Choices;
                }
            }
        }
    }
