# Exploring Asynchronous Programming and Multithreading with IronOCR

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/how-to/async/>***


Software development continuously evolves, and mastering the efficient processing of vast amounts of textual data is crucial. This guide elucidates the powerful combination of asynchronous programming and multithreading used in IronOCR and Tesseract. Asynchronous programming offers a non-blocking model that keeps our applications swift and efficient. Concurrently, we explore the benefits of multithreading, which significantly enhances text recognition performance. This article aims to simplify these concepts and demonstrate how you can improve both the efficiency and responsiveness of OCR-integrated apps.

<h3>Getting Started with IronOCR</h3>

--------------------------------------

## Insights into Multithreading

IronOCR enhances the processing of images and OCR reading through integrated multithreading, which utilizes all available CPU threads to optimize performance. This built-in feature streamlines development processes and significantly enhances OCR execution speed. Hereâ€™s how a typical multithreaded read can be efficiently handled:

```cs
using IronOcr;
using System;

var ocr = new IronTesseract();

using (var input = new OcrPdfInput(@"example.pdf"))
{
    var result = ocr.Read(input);
    Console.WriteLine(result.Text);
};
```

## Advantages of Async Support

Asynchronous programming, known as "async," is vital for boosting OCR tasks. Using async procedures allows your applications to process large documents or images efficiently without hindering other operations. Let's delve into the seamless integration of Async Support with IronOCR, illustrating various methods to implement non-blocking OCR services.

### Utilization of OcrReadTask Objects

IronOCR provides `OcrReadTask` objects to handle OCR operations more effectively. These objects offer enhanced control, making it easier to manage text recognition operations. Below, we outline how to use `OcrReadTask` objects to manage OCR tasks optimally:

```cs
using IronOcr;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();

OcrPdfInput largePdf = new OcrPdfInput("chapter1.pdf");

Func<OcrResult> reader = () =>
{
    return ocr.Read(largePdf);
};

OcrReadTask readTask = new OcrReadTask(reader.Invoke);
// Initiate the OCR task asynchronously
readTask.Start();

// Perform other tasks while OCR is processing
DoOtherTasks();

// Await the OCR task completion and access the results
OcrResult result = await Task.Run(() => readTask.Result);

Console.Write($"##### OCR RESULTS ###### \n {result.Text}");

largePdf.Dispose();
readTask.Dispose();

static void DoOtherTasks()
{
    // Simulate additional tasks during OCR processing
    Console.WriteLine("Performing other tasks...");
    Thread.Sleep(2000); // Simulate a delay
}
```

### Implementing Async Methods

`ReadAsync()` offers an easy way to start OCR operations asynchronously. This method simplifies integration into applications, ensuring the main thread remains unblocked for a responsive, agile application:

```cs
using IronOcr;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

IronTesseract ocr = new IronTesseract();

using (OcrPdfInput largePdf = new OcrPdfInput("PDFs/example.pdf"))
{
    var result = await ocr.ReadAsync(largePdf);
    DoOtherTasks();
    Console.Write($"##### OCR RESULTS ###### " +
                  $"\n {result.Text}");
}

static void DoOtherTasks()
{
    // Simulate other concurrent tasks
    Console.WriteLine("Performing other tasks...");
    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(2000); // Simulate a delay
}
```

## Conclusion

Integrating multithreading and utilizing `ReadAsync()` with IronOCR are pivotal for maximizing OCR performance. These mechanisms ensure your applications process large volumes efficiently while remaining highly responsive. This makes IronOCR an excellent choice for developing advanced software solutions that require sophisticated text handling.
